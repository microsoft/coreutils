A Microsoft-maintained build of [uutils/coreutils](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils),
[findutils](https://github.com/uutils/findutils), and [grep](https://github.com/uutils/grep) packaged as a
single multi-call binary for Windows. The goal is to make moving between Linux, macOS, WSL,
containers, and Windows frictionless: the same commands, flags, and pipelines work the same
way, so existing scripts carry over without translation.

Each command supports the standard `--help` flag for full syntax and options.

**This project is in preview.**

<br/>

## Install

Install Coreutils for Windows with WinGet:

```powershell
winget install Microsoft.Coreutils
```

Or grab the latest build from our [Release Page](https://github.com/microsoft/coreutils/releases/latest).

## Shell conflicts

> [!NOTE]
> Any command not mentioned is included in this suite. The following only lists conflicts.

> [!WARNING]
> PowerShell 7.4 or later is required.
> PowerShell 7.6 or later is recommended for `~` support.

Several commands share names with built-ins in CMD and PowerShell. Whether the Coreutils
version runs depends on the shell, the PATH order, and (for PowerShell) the alias table.

Legend: ✅ ships and works · ⚠️ ships but conflicts with a built-in · 🛑 not shipped

## Windows caveats

| Difference            | Detail |
| --------------------- | ------ |
| **CRLF line endings** | Windows text files often use CRLF (`\r\n`). Most utilities handle this transparently, but byte-oriented behavior can still observe the `\r`; for example, `uniq` may treat the final line as different from a preceding duplicate if the input uses CRLF and the final line has no trailing newline. |
| **No `/dev/null`**    | Use `NUL` instead, for example `find . -name "*.log" > NUL` |
| **No POSIX signals**  | Signals such as `SIGHUP`, `SIGPIPE`, and `SIGUSR` aren't available. `Ctrl+C` (`SIGINT`) works as expected. |
| **Path separators**   | Both `/` and `\` are accepted. Some utilities produce `\`-separated output, which can affect downstream piping. |
| **File permissions**  | Windows uses ACLs, not POSIX permission bits. Permission-based predicates (for example `find -perm`) may behave differently or be unavailable. |
| **Symbolic links**    | Reading existing symbolic links works without elevation. Creating new symbolic links requires Developer Mode ([**Settings > System > Advanced**](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/advanced-settings)) or an elevated terminal. |

### PowerShell Command Parsing

The installer integrates itself with interactive PowerShell sessions via `PSReadLine`.
It ensures that quoted expression behave somewhat like they do under UNIX shells or CMD:
`echo *.txt` will then print a number of file names, while `echo '*.txt'` will print "*.txt" literally.

There are two shortcomings, however:
* PowerShell's escape character is still <code>\`</code>, not <code>\\</code><br>
  While you may write `find . \( -foo -bar \)` with Bash, you still need to write ``find . `( -foo -bar `)`` in PowerShell.
* `Get-Command ls`, `Get-Help ls`, etc., will still show `ls`, etc., as builtin commands<br>
  Due to limitations around `PSNativeCommandPreserveBytePipe` we cannot integrate ourselves in a more robust way with PowerShell.

### Intentionally dropped

Commands that exist upstream but aren't shipped here because they rely on POSIX-only concepts, would break existing Windows scripts, or simply aren't useful on Windows.

* `dd`: Perhaps useful in the future.
* `dircolors`, `shred`, `sync`, `uname`: Not particularly useful on Windows.
* `chcon`, `chgrp`, `chmod`, `chown`, `chroot`, `groups`, `hostid`, `id`, `install`,
  `logname`, `mkfifo`, `mknod`, `nice`, `nohup`, `pinky`, `runcon`, `stdbuf`,
  `stty`, `tty`, `users`, `who`: POSIX-only concepts unavailable on Windows.
